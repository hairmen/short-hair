However, if you're not confident in your hairstyling skills, it's best to leave it to a professional. Q: What kind of face shape is best for short back and sides? A: Short back and sides is a versatile hairstyle that can suit any face shape. However, it's best to consult with a hairstylist to determine the best length and style for your face shape. <h2>Hair Care</h2> To keep an older man's hair looking great after a short back and sides haircut, follow these tips: - Shampoo and condition the hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy. - Use a leave-in conditioner to keep the hair soft and manageable. - Avoid using too much heat on the hair, such as blow dryers or flat irons, as it can damage the hair. - Trim the hair every 4-6 weeks to maintain the style and prevent split ends. </article>
