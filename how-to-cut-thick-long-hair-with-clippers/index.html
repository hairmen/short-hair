Use a towel to protect your clothing from any loose hair. Comb your hair straight, and divide it into sections using hair clips.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Clipper Guard</h3><p>Select the clipper guard that corresponds to the length you want for your hair. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one until you achieve the desired length. </p><h3>Step 3: Start Cutting</h3><p>Begin cutting your hair with the clippers, starting at the back of your head and working your way up. Use short strokes and work in the direction of hair growth. Be sure to use the comb to guide the clippers and keep your hair straight.</p><h3>Step 4: Blend the Sides and Back</h3><p>Once you have cut the back of your hair, blend the sides and back using the clippers without a guard. Use a comb to guide the clippers and create a seamless transition between the longer hair on top and the shorter hair on the sides and back.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Top</h3><p>Cut the top of your hair using scissors. Start at the front and work your way back, using the comb to lift sections of hair and cut them to the desired length. </p><h3>Step 6: Blend the Top and Sides</h3><p>Blend the top and sides of your hair using scissors. Use the comb to lift sections of hair and cut them to create a seamless transition between the longer hair on top and the shorter hair on the sides and back.</p><h3>Step 7: Check for Any Uneven Spots</h3><p>Use the mirror to check for any uneven spots or areas that need further blending. Use the clippers or scissors as needed to create a smooth and even look.</p><h3>Step 8: Clean Up the Neckline and Ears</h3><p>Use the clippers to clean up the neckline and around the ears. Use a shorter guard to create a clean and polished look.</p><h3>Step 9: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Once you have finished cutting your hair, style it as desired using your favorite products.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting your thick long hair with clippers:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter one to achieve the desired length.</li><li>Use the comb to guide the clippers and keep your hair straight.</li><li>Blend the longer hair on top with the shorter hair on the sides and back for a seamless look.</li><li>Check for any uneven spots or areas that need further blending, and use the clippers or scissors as needed to create a smooth and even look.</li><li>Always style your hair as desired using your favorite products.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Can I cut my thick long hair with clippers?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can cut your thick long hair with clippers.
