Repeat this process until all of your hair is curled. <h3>Perm Rods</h3> Perm rods are a great way to add curl to your hair without using heat. Start by sectioning your hair and applying a setting lotion. Then, take a small section of hair and wrap it around the perm rod. Secure the rod in place, then repeat this process until all of your hair is in perm rods. Leave the rods in overnight, or until your hair is completely dry. <h3>Flexi Rod Set</h3> A flexi rod set is similar to using perm rods, but the rods are more flexible and easier to work with. Start by sectioning your hair and applying a setting lotion. Then, take a small section of hair and wrap it around the flexi rod. Secure the rod in place, then repeat this process until all of your hair is in flexi rods. Leave the rods in overnight, or until your hair is completely dry. <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2> 1. Start with clean, dry hair. If your hair is wet, blow dry it on a low setting until it's completely dry. 2. Section your hair into small sections. The size of the sections will depend on the method you choose. 3. Apply a heat protectant spray or setting lotion to each section of hair. 4. Follow the instructions for the curling iron, perm rods, or flexi rod set method. 5. Once your hair is curled, use your fingers to separate the curls and create the desired look. <h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Curly Hair</h2> 1.
