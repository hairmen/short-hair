In fact, dressing well can help you feel confident, beautiful, and comfortable in your own skin. But as we age, our bodies change, and it can be challenging to find clothes that look good and feel comfortable. That's why we've put together this guide on how to dress at 60. Whether you're retired or still working, these tips will help you create a wardrobe that's both stylish and practical.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#step1">Step 1: Assess Your Body Shape</a></li><li><a href="#step2">Step 2: Choose the Right Clothes</a></li><li><a href="#step3">Step 3: Accessorize with Jewelry and Scarves</a></li><li><a href="#step4">Step 4: Invest in Comfortable Shoes</a></li><li><a href="#step5">Step 5: Dress for the Occasion</a></li><li><a href="#step6">Step 6: Follow Fashion Trends</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Dressing at 60</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#haircare">Hair Care Tips for Women Over 60</a></li></ul><h2 id="step1">Step 1: Assess Your Body Shape</h2><p>The first step in dressing well at 60 is to assess your body shape. As we age, our bodies change, and it's essential to find clothes that flatter our new curves and angles. Take a good look in the mirror and identify your body shape. Are you an apple, pear, hourglass, or rectangle? Once you've identified your body shape, you can choose clothes that accentuate your best features and hide any problem areas.</p><h3>Apple Shape</h3><p>If you have an apple shape, you carry most of your weight around your midsection. To flatter this shape, choose clothes that draw attention to your legs and arms, such as A-line dresses, tunics, and tops that flow away from the midsection. Avoid clothes that cling to your stomach and waist, such as tight-fitting tops and skinny jeans.</p><h3>Pear Shape</h3><p>If you have a pear shape, you carry most of your weight around your hips and thighs. To flatter this shape, choose clothes that draw attention to your upper body, such as boatneck tops, V-necks, and off-the-shoulder tops. Avoid clothes that cling to your hips and thighs, such as skinny jeans and tight-fitting skirts.</p><h3>Hourglass Shape</h3><p>If you have an hourglass shape, you have a balanced proportion of hips and bust with a defined waist. To flatter this shape, choose clothes that emphasize your waist, such as belted dresses, high-waisted pants, and fitted tops. Avoid clothes that hide your waist, such as shapeless dresses and baggy tops.</p><h3>Rectangle Shape</h3><p>If you have a rectangle shape, your hips and bust are about the same size, and you have a less defined waist. To flatter this shape, choose clothes that create curves, such as wrap dresses, peplum tops, and A-line skirts. Avoid clothes that hide your shape, such as shapeless dresses and baggy tops.</p><p>By choosing clothes that flatter your body shape, you'll look and feel your best at 60.</p><h2 id="step2">Step 2: Choose the Right Clothes</h2><p>Now that you've identified your body shape, it's time to choose the right clothes. When shopping for clothes, look for fabrics that feel comfortable against your skin, such as cotton, linen, and silk. Avoid fabrics that are too tight or too heavy, such as polyester and wool.</p><p>Invest in classic pieces that never go out of style, such as a little black dress, a tailored blazer, and a pair of well-fitting jeans. These pieces can be dressed up or down and will last for years to come. When choosing colors, opt for neutrals such as black, white, beige, and navy. These colors can be mixed and matched and are easy to accessorize.</p><p>Don't be afraid to experiment with patterns and prints. Choose prints that flatter your body shape, such as small prints for petite frames and larger prints for taller frames. Mix and match patterns, such as polka dots and stripes, for a fun and playful look.</p><h2 id="step3">Step 3: Accessorize with Jewelry and Scarves</h2><p>Jewelry and scarves are an excellent way to add personality and style to any outfit. Choose pieces that are appropriate for the occasion, such as a statement necklace for a night out or a simple pendant for a casual lunch with friends. When choosing scarves, opt for lightweight fabrics such as silk and cashmere for a luxurious feel.</p><p>Accessorizing is also an excellent way to draw attention to your best features. For example, if you have beautiful eyes, choose earrings that draw attention to your face. If you have a long neck, choose a necklace that accentuates it.</p><h2 id="step4">Step 4: Invest in Comfortable Shoes</h2><p>Comfortable shoes are essential for women over 60. Look for shoes that offer support and cushioning, such as sneakers, loafers, and sandals with a low heel. Avoid shoes that are too high or too tight, as they can cause foot pain and discomfort.</p><p>Invest in a few pairs of shoes that are appropriate for different occasions, such as a pair of sneakers for walking, a pair of loafers for casual outings, and a pair of dressy sandals for formal occasions.</p><h2 id="step5">Step 5: Dress for the Occasion</h2><p>When dressing for an occasion, it's essential to consider the dress code. If you're unsure what to wear, ask the host or check the invitation for clues. For formal occasions, such as weddings and galas, opt for a long dress or a pantsuit. For casual outings, such as lunch with friends, choose a pair of jeans and a blouse. And for professional settings, such as business meetings, choose a tailored suit or a dress with a blazer.</p><h2 id="step6">Step 6: Follow Fashion Trends</h2><p>While it's essential to choose classic pieces that never go out of style, it's also fun to follow fashion trends. Choose a few key pieces each season that reflect current trends, such as a statement coat or a pair of boots. This will keep your wardrobe fresh and up-to-date.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Dressing at 60</h2><ul><li>Choose clothes that flatter your body shape.</li><li>Invest in classic pieces that never go out of style.</li><li>Choose fabrics that feel comfortable against your skin.</li><li>Accessorize with jewelry and scarves.</li><li>Invest in comfortable shoes.</li><li>Dress for the occasion.</li><li>Follow fashion trends.</li><li>Don't be afraid to experiment with patterns and prints.</li><li>Mix and match colors for a fun and playful look.</li><li>Choose clothes that make you feel confident and beautiful.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>What should I wear to a casual lunch with friends?</h3><p>For a casual lunch with friends, choose a pair of jeans and a blouse.
