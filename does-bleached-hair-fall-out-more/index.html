Hot styling tools can further damage your hair and cause it to fall out.</p><h2 id="step-by-step-bleaching-process">Step-by-Step Bleaching Process</h2><p>The bleaching process is a multi-step process that involves the use of chemicals to lighten your hair. The first step is to mix the bleach powder and developer together. You should then apply the mixture to your hair and leave it on for the recommended amount of time. Once your hair has lightened to the desired shade, you should rinse the bleach out of your hair and apply a good quality hair conditioner.</p><h2 id="tips-to-keep-your-hair-healthy-after-bleaching">Tips to Keep Your Hair Healthy After Bleaching</h2><p>If you want to keep your hair healthy after bleaching, there are a few things you can do.

Over-bleaching can damage your hair and cause it to fall out.
