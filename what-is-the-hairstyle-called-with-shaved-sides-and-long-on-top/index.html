This hairstyle has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it's not hard to see why. It's a versatile look that can be adapted to suit a range of different styles, from punk rock to hipster chic. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at this hairstyle, including what it's called, how to achieve it, and how to care for it.</p><h2>What is the Hairstyle Called?</h2><p>The hairstyle with shaved sides and long on top is commonly referred to as an undercut. This is because the hair on the sides and back of the head is shaved or cut very short, while the hair on top is left long. The contrast between the short sides and long top creates a dramatic and eye-catching effect that is perfect for those who want to make a statement with their hairstyle.</p><h2>How to Achieve the Undercut Hairstyle</h2><p>If you're interested in getting an undercut hairstyle, the first step is to find a skilled hairstylist who can help you achieve the look you want. You'll need to decide on the length of hair you want on top, as well as the length of hair you want on the sides and back. Your hairstylist will then use clippers or scissors to cut the hair on the sides and back to the desired length.</p><p>Once the sides and back are cut, your hairstylist will focus on the hair on top. This will involve layering and shaping the hair to create the desired effect. Depending on the length of your hair, your hairstylist may also use a razor to add texture and dimension to the hairstyle.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Achieve the Undercut Hairstyle</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving the undercut hairstyle:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose Your Length</h3><p>Decide on the length of hair you want on top, as well as the length of hair you want on the sides and back.

If you're doing this at home, make sure you have a good quality pair of clippers and a steady hand.</p><h3>Step 3: Layer and Shape the Top</h3><p>Your hairstylist will focus on the hair on top, layering and shaping it to create the desired effect. If you're doing this at home, make sure you have a good quality pair of scissors and a mirror to help you see what you're doing.</p><h3>Step 4: Add Texture and Dimension</h3><p>Depending on the length of your hair, your hairstylist may use a razor to add texture and dimension to the hairstyle. This will create a more edgy and dramatic look.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Undercut Hairstyle</h2><p>Once you've achieved your undercut hairstyle, it's important to take good care of it to ensure it looks its best. Here are some tips for maintaining your undercut hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Get regular trims to keep the sides and back looking neat and tidy.</li><li>Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and nourished.</li><li>Consider using a styling product, such as pomade or wax, to help keep the hair on top in place.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can cause damage and make it harder to style.</li></ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the undercut hairstyle:</p><h3>Is the undercut hairstyle suitable for all hair types?</h3><p>Yes, the undercut hairstyle can be adapted to suit a range of different hair types, from straight to curly.</p><h3>How often do I need to get a trim?</h3><p>You'll need to get a trim every 4-6 weeks to keep the sides and back looking neat and tidy.</p><h3>Can I style my hair in different ways with an undercut?</h3><p>Yes, the hair on top can be styled in a range of different ways, from slicked back to messy and textured.</p><h2>Hair Care for Undercut Hairstyle</h2><p>Proper hair care is important to maintain your undercut hairstyle. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and conditioner to keep it clean and healthy.</li><li>Avoid using hot water when washing your hair, as this can strip it of its natural oils.</li><li>Towel dry your hair gently, rather than rubbing it vigorously with a towel.</li><li>Use a hair dryer on a low heat setting to dry your hair, and avoid using it too often.</li><li>Apply a styling product, such as pomade or wax, to the hair on top to help keep it in place.</li></ul><p>Overall, the undercut hairstyle is a bold and edgy look that can be adapted to suit a range of different styles.
