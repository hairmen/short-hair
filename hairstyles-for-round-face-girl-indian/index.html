Bob</h3> A classic bob is a great option for girls with a round face. Choose a chin-length bob with subtle layers to add texture and volume. <h3>4. Pixie Cut</h3> A pixie cut is a bold and edgy hairstyle that looks great on round faces. Opt for a pixie cut with short layers to add volume and texture. <h3>5. High Ponytail</h3> A high ponytail is a simple and easy hairstyle that can make your face appear longer.

Can I wear my hair in a middle part if I have a round face?</h3> Yes, you can wear your hair in a middle part if you have a round face.
