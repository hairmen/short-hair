Women's clothing became less formal and more practical. The mini skirt was introduced, and it quickly became the must-have item of the decade.

Mod fashion was also popular, which featured clean lines, bold graphics, and geometric shapes. </p><h2 id="bold-colors">Bold Colors</h2><p>The 60s was all about vibrant, eye-catching colors. Bright pinks, oranges, yellows, and greens were popular, as were bold patterns like polka dots and stripes. The color blocking trend was also introduced, which involved combining contrasting colors in one outfit. </p><p>Black and white was also a popular color combination. The 'little black dress' was still a staple in every woman's wardrobe, but it was often paired with white accessories, such as shoes and handbags. </p><h2 id="accessories">Accessories</h2><p>Accessories were an essential part of 60s fashion. Oversized sunglasses, headbands, and hoop earrings were all the rage. Women also wore chunky jewelry made from plastic or wood. </p><p>Handbags were also an important accessory.
