Castor oil also has high viscosity, which makes it an excellent moisturizer for dry and brittle hair.</p><h3>3.

Use a comb to create even parts.</p><h3>4. Apply the Hair Oil</h3><p>Apply the hair oil to your scalp and hair using your fingertips. Massage the oil into your scalp for a few minutes to improve blood circulation.</p><h3>5. Leave it On</h3><p>Leave the hair oil on for at least 30 minutes or overnight for maximum benefits.</p><h3>6.

Don't Overuse Hair Oil</h3><p>Using too much hair oil can make your hair greasy and weigh it down. Use a moderate amount of hair oil and focus on the scalp and hair ends.</p><h3>2. Use a Satin Pillowcase</h3><p>Using a satin pillowcase can help reduce friction and prevent hair breakage while you sleep.</p><h3>3. Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy diet that is rich in vitamins and minerals can help promote hair growth from the inside out.</p><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions about Hair Oil for Hair Growth</h2><h3>1.
