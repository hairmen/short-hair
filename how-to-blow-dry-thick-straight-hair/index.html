Just use your fingers to pull the hair taut as you direct the heat from the blow dryer. Q: How can I reduce frizz when blow-drying my hair? A: Use a heat protectant spray and a hair serum or oil to reduce frizz. You can also try using a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to distribute the heat more evenly.
