However, if you notice excessive shedding or bald patches, it's a good idea to consult with a pediatrician.</p><h3>Can cradle cap cause hair loss?</h3><p>Cradle cap is a common condition that can cause flaky, scaly patches on the scalp. While it doesn't usually cause hair loss, it can make hair look thinner. If your baby has cradle cap, your pediatrician may recommend a special shampoo or cream to help clear it up.</p><h3>Will my baby's hair grow back?</h3><p>Yes, in most cases, hair loss in babies is temporary and hair will eventually grow back. However, it may take several months for new hair to fully grow in.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Babies</h2><p>Caring for your baby's hair can be a fun and bonding experience.
