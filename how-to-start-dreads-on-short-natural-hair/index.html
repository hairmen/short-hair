Starting dreads on short hair can be challenging, but with the right technique and a little patience, you can achieve beautiful, healthy locks. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of starting dreads on short natural hair, including how to section your hair, how to twist and set your locks, and how to care for your dreads to keep them looking their best. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ul><li><a href="#sectioning">Sectioning Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#twisting">Twisting and Setting Your Locks</a></li><li><a href="#maintenance">Dreadlock Maintenance and Care</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li></ul><h2 id="sectioning"> Sectioning Your Hair </h2><p> The first step in starting dreads on short natural hair is to section your hair into small, even parts. Use a rat-tail comb to create sections that are roughly the same size as the dreadlocks you want to achieve. If you're not sure what size you want your dreads to be, start with smaller sections, as it's easier to combine smaller dreads into larger ones later on. </p><p> Once you've sectioned your hair, use small rubber bands to secure each section at the base. This will keep your hair from unraveling as you begin to twist and knot your locks. </p><h2 id="twisting"> Twisting and Setting Your Locks </h2><p> With your hair sectioned and secured, it's time to start twisting and knotting your locks. There are a few different techniques you can use to start your dreads, including the palm roll method, the twist and rip method, and the backcombing method. Each method has its pros and cons, so choose the one that feels most comfortable for you. </p><p> As you twist and knot your locks, be sure to work from the roots to the tips of your hair. Use a small amount of locking gel or wax to help hold your locks in place, but be careful not to use too much, as this can lead to buildup and damage to your hair. </p><p> Once you've twisted and set your locks, cover your head with a satin or silk scarf to help your hair lock in place. You can also use a hair dryer on a low heat setting to help set your locks more quickly. </p><h2 id="maintenance"> Dreadlock Maintenance and Care </h2><p> Now that you've started your dreadlock journey, it's important to take good care of your hair to keep your locks healthy and looking their best. Here are a few tips for maintaining and caring for your dreads: </p><ul><li> Wash your hair regularly with a residue-free shampoo to prevent buildup and keep your locks clean and healthy. </li><li> Avoid using heavy oils or products on your hair, as this can weigh down your locks and make them harder to maintain. </li><li> Use a crochet hook or interlocking tool to tighten your locks and keep them neat and tidy. </li><li> Sleep on a satin or silk pillowcase to prevent your hair from drying out and breaking. </li></ul><h2 id="faq"> FAQs </h2><h3> How long does it take to start dreads on short hair? </h3><p> The time it takes to start dreads on short hair depends on a variety of factors, including your hair type, the method you use to start your locks, and how often you maintain and care for your dreads. On average, it can take anywhere from six months to a year or more to achieve fully matured locks. </p><h3> Can you start dreads on relaxed hair? </h3><p> Yes, you can start dreads on relaxed hair, but it's important to note that the chemicals used in relaxers can weaken and damage your hair, making it more difficult to maintain and care for your locks. If you have relaxed hair, consider transitioning to natural hair before starting your dreadlock journey. </p><h3> Do you need to cut your hair to start dreads? </h3><p> No, you don't need to cut your hair to start dreads. However, it's important to note that starting dreads on longer hair can be easier, as you have more hair to work with and can create larger, fuller locks. </p><p> With these tips and techniques, you can start your dreadlock journey on short natural hair with confidence and ease. Remember to be patient and take good care of your hair, and you'll be on your way to beautiful, healthy locks in no time! </p></article>
