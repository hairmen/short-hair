Clip-in extensions can last up to a year, while sew-in and micro-ring extensions can last up to 6 months. Q: Can I dye my extensions?<br/> A: It's best to avoid dyeing your extensions, as this can damage them. If you must dye them, take them to a professional. <h2>Hair Care</h2> To keep your natural hair healthy and strong, it's important to take good care of it. This means washing it regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner, avoiding heat styling tools, and using a deep conditioning treatment once a week. It's also important to eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals, as this can help promote healthy hair growth. <h2>Conclusion</h2> In conclusion, hair extensions are a great option for those with short hair who want to add length and volume. When choosing extensions, consider the type, length, and color to ensure they blend well with your natural hair. Follow the application instructions carefully and take good care of your extensions to ensure they last as long as possible. With the right extensions and proper care, you can achieve the look you desire! </article>
