Whether you&#39;re going for a slicked back look, a messy side part, or a more relaxed and natural look, there are a few key steps you should follow to achieve the best results. In this guide, we&#39;ll take you through the steps for styling men&#39;s hair to the side, including tips for choosing the right haircut, products to use, and techniques for creating the perfect side part. How To: Style Men&#39;s Hair To The Side The first step in styling men&#39;s hair to the side is to choose the right haircut. Depending on the look you&#39;re going for, you may want to opt for a shorter or longer cut. Shorter cuts are great for a more polished look, while longer cuts work well for a more relaxed and natural look. Once you have the right haircut, it&#39;s time to choose the right products. Depending on your hair type and the look you&#39;re going for, you may want to use a styling cream, pomade, or wax. If you have fine hair, a lightweight cream or pomade will work best, while thicker hair can handle a stronger hold wax. Step-by-Step Guide 1. Start with clean, towel-dried hair. Apply a small amount of styling cream or pomade to your hair, rubbing it in evenly from root to tip. 2. Use a comb to create a side part. Depending on your hair type, you may want to create a deeper or more subtle part. Use the end of the comb to create a clean, straight line. 3. Comb your hair to one side, using your fingers to create a natural-looking tousled effect. 4. Use a hair dryer on low heat to set the style, using your fingers to gently shape your hair into place. 5. Apply a small amount of wax or pomade to your fingertips, and use it to define the ends of your hair. 6. Finish with a light mist of hairspray to set the style in place. Tips for Styling Men&#39;s Hair To The Side - Experiment with different products to find the one that works best for your hair type and the look you&#39;re going for. - Use a comb or your fingers to create a natural-looking tousled effect. - Don&#39;t be afraid to try different parting styles to find the one that works best for you. - Use a hair dryer on low heat to set the style, but be careful not to over-dry your hair, as this can cause damage and breakage. FAQ Q: How often should I wash my hair if I&#39;m styling it to the side? A: It&#39;s best to wash your hair every other day to avoid stripping it of its natural oils. Q: How do I prevent my hair from looking greasy when using wax or pomade? A: Use a small amount of product, and be sure to distribute it evenly throughout your hair. Avoid applying too much product to the roots, as this can cause your hair to look greasy. Hair Care Tips - Use a shampoo and conditioner that are formulated for your hair type. - Avoid using hot tools like flat irons and curling irons, as these can cause damage and breakage. - Get regular trims to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends. - Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair hydrated and nourished.

Shorter cuts are great for a more polished look, while longer cuts work well for a more relaxed and natural look. Once you have the right haircut, it's time to choose the right products. Depending on your hair type and the look you're going for, you may want to use a styling cream, pomade, or wax. If you have fine hair, a lightweight cream or pomade will work best, while thicker hair can handle a stronger hold wax. <h3 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h3> 1. Start with clean, towel-dried hair. Apply a small amount of styling cream or pomade to your hair, rubbing it in evenly from root to tip. 2. Use a comb to create a side part. Depending on your hair type, you may want to create a deeper or more subtle part. Use the end of the comb to create a clean, straight line. 3. Comb your hair to one side, using your fingers to create a natural-looking tousled effect. 4. Use a hair dryer on low heat to set the style, using your fingers to gently shape your hair into place. 5. Apply a small amount of wax or pomade to your fingertips, and use it to define the ends of your hair. 6. Finish with a light mist of hairspray to set the style in place. <h3 id="tips">Tips for Styling Men's Hair To The Side</h3> - Experiment with different products to find the one that works best for your hair type and the look you're going for. - Use a comb or your fingers to create a natural-looking tousled effect. - Don't be afraid to try different parting styles to find the one that works best for you. - Use a hair dryer on low heat to set the style, but be careful not to over-dry your hair, as this can cause damage and breakage. <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3> Q: How often should I wash my hair if I'm styling it to the side?
