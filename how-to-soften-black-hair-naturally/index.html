Opt for sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair moisturized and healthy.</p><h3>2. Don't over-wash your hair</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can also strip it of its natural oils. Aim to wash your hair every 2-3 days, depending on your hair type and lifestyle.</p><h3>3. Use a deep-conditioning treatment once a week</h3><p>Deep-conditioning treatments are a great way to moisturize and soften your hair. Apply a hair mask or oil treatment once a week to keep your hair looking and feeling healthy.</p><h3>4. Avoid heat styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can damage your hair and leave it dry and brittle.
