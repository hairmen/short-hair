Men's hairstyles in the 1960s were no exception, with a variety of looks that reflected the cultural shifts of the era. From the classic crew cut to the iconic mod style, there was a hairstyle for every man in the 1960s.</p><h2>Description of 1960 Hairstyles Men's</h2><p>The 1960s saw a shift away from the conservative hairstyles of the 1950s, as men began experimenting with longer hair and more expressive styles. The classic crew cut remained popular, but was often worn with longer bangs or a slightly longer top. The pompadour, made famous by Elvis Presley, was also a popular style in the early 1960s.</p><p>As the decade progressed, men's hairstyles became even more daring and expressive. The mod style, characterized by a longer, shaggy cut and a fringe that fell over the forehead, became synonymous with the fashion and music of the era. The Beatles famously sported this style, and it quickly became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>Other popular hairstyles for men in the 1960s included the slicked-back look, which was achieved by using pomade or gel to slick the hair back and create a shiny, polished look. The afro also emerged as a popular style among black men, and was often worn with a pick to create volume and texture.</p><h2>How to Achieve 1960 Hairstyles Men's</h2><p>If you're interested in achieving a 1960s-inspired hairstyle, there are a few key steps you'll need to follow.
