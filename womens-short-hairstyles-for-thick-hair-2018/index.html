Do you want a haircut that is low-maintenance and stylish? Look no further than women's short hairstyles for thick hair 2018. These haircuts are perfect for those who want to embrace their thick hair and create a look that is both chic and effortless. In this article, we'll cover the best short hairstyles for thick hair, how to style them, and how to care for your hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Thick hair can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, you have a lot of volume and texture to work with. On the other hand, it can be difficult to manage and style. That's where short hairstyles come in. By cutting your hair short, you can create a look that is easy to style and maintain. Plus, short haircuts can make your thick hair look even fuller and more voluminous.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>There are many different short hairstyles to choose from, but some of the most popular for thick hair include the pixie cut, the bob, and the lob. The pixie cut is a short, edgy haircut that is perfect for those who want a low-maintenance look. The bob is a classic haircut that looks great on everyone, and the lob (or long bob) is a slightly longer version of the bob that is perfect for those who want a little more length.</p><p>When styling your short hair, it's important to use the right products. A volumizing mousse or spray can help add texture and body to your hair, while a styling cream or pomade can help define your layers and create a more polished look. Don't be afraid to experiment with different products and techniques until you find what works best for you.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>If you're considering a short haircut for your thick hair, here are some steps to follow:</p><ol><li>Choose a haircut that complements your face shape and hair texture.</li><li>Consult with your hairstylist to determine the best length and style for your hair.</li><li>Wash and condition your hair with products that are designed for your hair type.</li><li>Apply a volumizing product to your roots and blow-dry your hair, using a round brush to add volume.</li><li>Use a flat iron or curling iron to add texture and definition to your hair.</li><li>Finish with a hairspray or other styling product to hold your hair in place.</li></ol><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when styling your short hair:</p><ul><li>Use a heat protectant spray to prevent damage from styling tools.</li><li>Don't over-wash your hair, as this can strip it of its natural oils and make it look dull.</li><li>Experiment with different styling products to find what works best for your hair type.</li><li>Invest in a good quality hairbrush or comb to help detangle and style your hair.</li><li>Consider getting regular trims to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some commonly asked questions about women's short hairstyles for thick hair:</p><h3>Q: Will a short haircut make my hair look even thicker?</h3><p>A: Yes, a short haircut can make your hair look even fuller and more voluminous. However, this can be a good thing if you want to embrace your thick hair and create a bold, statement-making look.</p><h3>Q: What if I have curly or wavy hair?</h3><p>A: Short haircuts can look great on curly or wavy hair, too. Just be sure to choose a style that works with your natural texture, and use products that are designed for curly or wavy hair to help define your curls and waves.</p><h3>Q: How often should I get my hair trimmed?</h3><p>A: It's a good idea to get your hair trimmed every 6-8 weeks, depending on how quickly your hair grows. Regular trims can help keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>When it comes to caring for your thick hair, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, be sure to use products that are designed for your hair type. This can help keep your hair looking healthy and prevent damage from styling tools. Second, try not to over-wash your hair, as this can strip it of its natural oils and make it look dull. Finally, consider getting regular trims to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</p><p>With these tips in mind, you'll be able to embrace your thick hair and rock a stylish short haircut in no time.
