This trendy haircut features shaved sides and longer hair on top, creating a striking contrast that is both stylish and low-maintenance. In this post, we'll walk you through the steps of how to do an undercut girl, from choosing the right style to caring for your new 'do.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#choosing-style">Choosing the Right Undercut Girl Style</a></li><li><a href="#prep-hair">Preparing Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#sectioning-hair">Sectioning Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#clipping-hair">Clipping Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#shaving-sides">Shaving the Sides</a></li><li><a href="#trimming-top">Trimming the Top</a></li><li><a href="#styling-hair">Styling Your Undercut Girl</a></li><li><a href="#maintenance-tips">Maintenance Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Tips</a></li></ol><h2 id="choosing-style">Choosing the Right Undercut Girl Style</h2><p>The first step in how to do an undercut girl is deciding on the right style for you. There are many variations of this haircut, so it's important to choose a style that suits your face shape, hair texture, and personal style. Here are a few popular options:</p><h3>The Classic Undercut</h3><p>The classic undercut girl features shaved sides and a longer top that can be styled in a variety of ways. This style works well for those with straight or wavy hair, and it's particularly flattering for round or oval face shapes.</p><h3>The Pixie Undercut</h3><p>The pixie undercut girl takes the classic style a step further, with even shorter sides and a more dramatic contrast between the top and sides. This look is perfect for those with fine hair or a petite face shape.</p><h3>The Shaggy Undercut</h3><p>The shaggy undercut girl features choppy layers on top and slightly longer sides that blend into the length of the hair. This style is ideal for those with thick or curly hair, and it adds a playful, edgy vibe to any look.</p><h2 id="prep-hair">Preparing Your Hair</h2><p>Before you start cutting, it's important to prepare your hair properly. This will ensure that your haircut turns out even and polished. Here's what you need to do:</p><p>1. Wash and dry your hair thoroughly, using a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup or product residue.</p><p>2. Comb your hair straight back from your forehead, and tie it into a ponytail at the crown of your head. This will keep the hair on top of your head out of the way while you shave the sides.</p><p>3. Apply a small amount of styling product to the top of your hair, if desired. This will make it easier to see the length and texture of the hair as you cut.</p><h2 id="sectioning-hair">Sectioning Your Hair</h2><p>Now it's time to start sectioning your hair. This will ensure that you shave the sides evenly and without any stray hairs. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Using a comb, create a horizontal parting from behind one ear to the other, clipping the top section of hair out of the way.</p><p>2. Repeat the process on the other side, creating another horizontal parting that separates the hair at the back of your head from the hair at the front.</p><p>3. Take the bottom section of hair that is not clipped up and clip it away from the hair on top of your head. This will give you easy access to the sides of your hair.</p><h2 id="clipping-hair">Clipping Your Hair</h2><p>Before you start shaving, you'll need to clip your hair to the desired length. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Choose the clipper guard that corresponds to the length you want for your undercut girl. Start with a longer guard and work your way down if you want a shorter cut.</p><p>2. Starting at the nape of your neck, use the clippers to shave upwards, following the natural curve of your head. Work your way up to the parting line that you created earlier.</p><p>3. Repeat on the other side, using the same guard and technique.</p><p>4. If you want a more dramatic undercut girl, you can shave the sides even shorter using a smaller guard or no guard at all. Be careful not to shave too high or too far back, as this can create an uneven or unflattering look.</p><h2 id="shaving-sides">Shaving the Sides</h2><p>Now it's time to shave the sides of your hair. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Starting at the nape of your neck, use the clippers to shave upwards, following the natural curve of your head. Stop at the parting line that you created earlier.</p><p>2. Repeat on the other side, using the same technique.</p><p>3. Use a handheld mirror to check the back of your head, and touch up any areas that need it.</p><h2 id="trimming-top">Trimming the Top</h2><p>Now that the sides are shaved, it's time to trim the hair on top of your head. Here's how to do it:</p><p>1. Remove the ponytail holder that is holding your hair in place. Comb your hair straight down, and use hair cutting scissors to trim the ends to the desired length.</p><p>2. If you want a shaggy or layered look, you can use the scissors to create choppy, textured ends.</p><p>3. Use a handheld mirror to check the sides and back of your head, and touch up any areas that need it.</p><h2 id="styling-hair">Styling Your Undercut Girl</h2><p>Now that your haircut is complete, it's time to style it! Here are a few popular styling options:</p><h3>The Messy Bun</h3><p>Pull your hair back into a messy bun at the crown of your head for a casual, effortless look.</p><h3>The Half-Up, Half-Down</h3><p>Take a section of hair from the front of your head, and pull it back into a half-up, half-down style. This look is perfect for showing off your undercut girl while still keeping some length on top.</p><h3>The Slicked-Back</h3><p>Apply a small amount of pomade or gel to the top of your hair, and comb it straight back for a sleek, sophisticated look.</p><h2 id="maintenance-tips">Maintenance Tips</h2><p>To keep your undercut girl looking sharp, follow these maintenance tips:</p><p>1. Schedule regular touch-ups with your hairstylist to keep the sides neatly shaved.</p><p>2. Use a good quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</p><p>3. Experiment with different styling products and techniques to find the look that works best for you.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><p>Q: Will an undercut girl work for my hair type?</p><p>A: Yes! Undercut girls can work for all hair types, from straight to curly to thick.</p><p>Q: Will an undercut girl look good on me?</p><p>A: Undercut girls can look great on anyone, but it's important to choose a style that flatters your face shape and personal style.</p><p>Q: Is it easy to maintain an undercut girl?</p><p>A: Yes! Undercut girls are low-maintenance, and they require minimal styling and upkeep.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips</h2><p>To keep your hair looking its best, follow these hair care tips:</p><p>1. Wash your hair regularly, using a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup or product residue.</p><p>2. Use a good quality conditioner to keep your hair hydrated and healthy.</p><p>3. Avoid using heat styling tools too frequently, as this can damage your hair over time.</p><p>4. Get regular trims to keep your hair looking neat and healthy.</p><p>With this step-by-step guide, you now know how to do an undercut girl with ease. Whether you opt for a classic, pixie, or shaggy style, this edgy haircut is sure to turn heads and make a statement. Just remember to maintain your new 'do with regular touch-ups and quality hair care products, and you'll be rocking your undercut girl in style for months to come.</p></article>
