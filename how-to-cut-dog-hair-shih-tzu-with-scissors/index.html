Let’s get started!</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The Shih Tzu is a small breed of dog that is known for its long and thick coat of hair. They require regular grooming to keep their hair from matting, tangling, and becoming uncomfortable for them. While you can take them to a professional groomer, you can also learn how to cut their hair at home with scissors. The process is not too difficult, but it does require patience, time, and the right tools.</p><h2>How to Cut Dog Hair Shih Tzu with Scissors</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>The first step in learning how to cut dog hair Shih Tzu with scissors is to gather your tools. You will need a pair of scissors designed for cutting dog hair, a comb, and some treats to reward your dog for staying still.</p><h3>Step 2: Bathe and Dry Your Dog</h3><p>Before you start cutting your dog’s hair, you should bathe and dry them. This will make their hair easier to work with and remove any tangles or knots. Make sure to use a dog shampoo that is gentle on their skin and coat.</p><h3>Step 3: Brush Your Dog’s Hair</h3><p>Once your dog is dry, you should brush their hair to remove any remaining tangles or knots. Use a comb to separate their hair into sections, and then gently brush each section from the roots to the ends.</p><h3>Step 4: Start Cutting</h3><p>Now it’s time to start cutting your dog’s hair. Begin by trimming the hair around their eyes, ears, and paws. Use the scissors to cut the hair to the desired length, but be careful not to cut too much.</p><h3>Step 5: Trim the Body and Legs</h3><p>Next, you should trim the hair on your dog’s body and legs. Use the comb to separate the hair into sections, and then trim the hair to the desired length. Be sure to use a comb to guide the scissors and avoid cutting too much hair at once.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with the Tail</h3><p>Finally, you should trim the hair on your dog’s tail. Use the scissors to cut the hair to the desired length, but be careful not to cut too much. You can also use the comb to guide the scissors and ensure an even cut.</p><h2>Tips</h2><ul><li>Start with small cuts and work your way up to avoid cutting too much hair at once.</li><li>Use a comb to guide the scissors and ensure an even cut.</li><li>Take breaks and give your dog treats to keep them calm and still.</li><li>Be careful not to cut your dog’s skin or ears.</li><li>If you’re unsure about cutting your dog’s hair, consult with a professional groomer.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>1.
