The condition occurs when the immune system attacks hair follicles, which leads to hair loss in patches. The cause of alopecia areata is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to genetics and environmental factors.</p><p>One of the most common types of alopecia areata is patchy hair loss, which is characterized by round, bald patches on the scalp.

However, many people with alopecia areata require treatment to promote hair growth.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Grow Hair Back After Alopecia Areata</h2><p>If you have alopecia areata and want to promote hair growth, there are several things you can do.
